## Project Overview

The dashboard highlights key metrics such as total revenue, product performance, sales distribution, and time-based trends to enable data-driven decision-making for stakeholders in the confectionery industry.

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – Used to design interactive visual dashboards.
- **Power Query** – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and column derivation.

##  Data Transformation

Two important custom columns were derived using Power Query to enhance analysis:

- **Sales Category**
  - `Low Sales` → ≤ 5,000  
  - `Medium Sales` → > 5,000 and ≤ 10,000  
  - `High Sales` → > 10,000 and ≤ 20,000  
  - `Very High Sales` → > 20,000  

- **Day Type (Weekday/Weekend)**
  - `Weekday` → Monday to Friday  
  - `Weekend` → Saturday and Sunday

These transformations enabled clearer segmentation of data and allowed for focused insight extraction.
